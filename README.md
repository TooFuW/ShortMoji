## Installation
**Download the latest version [HERE](https://github.com/TooFuW/ShortMoji/releases/latest) !** 🤩

If you want the program to launch automatically when you turn on your computer press `⊞ Win`+`R` and type `shell:startup`.  
Then create a shortcut (`Right-click` -> `New` -> `Shortcut`) and paste the path to `ShortMoji.exe` (for example `C:\Users\User\Downloads\ShortMoji.exe`) and that's it, you won't have to open it manually anymore !  
(Only for Windows, I don't even know if the program works on MacOS)

*Your antivirus might flag the program as a virus on the first run but it's a false positive (you can check the code, everything is in main.py) don't worry !* 😅

## How to use it
Type a shortcut from the list [HERE](https://github.com/TooFuW/ShortMoji?tab=readme-ov-file#keyboard-shortcuts), press `space` and it will automatically be replaced by the corresponding emoji, it's that simple ! 🥳

*The program may not always work in system applications (e.g. Task Manager) because Windows blocks keyboard access at that time*

If you want to close the program, just press your `escape` key twice !

## Usage and Features
Launch ShortMoji and start typing your shortcuts to see your emojis appear automatically ! ✨

- **Easy shortcuts** : If you are already using Discord then it should be easy for you to start using ShortMoji, else GO LEARN THE SHORTCUTS ! 🗿

- **Fast correction** : If you misspell a shortcut, you can retype it (if you do it right away) and the emoji will still replace the shortcut ! 😎

- **For the nerds** : ShortMoji is a lightweight utility program that doesn't slow down your system. And if you want, you can easily close the program by clicking your Escape key twice ! 🤓

- **Audience** : Whether you're a developper looking for efficiency, a casual user who enjoys using emojis or a Discord user who's already familiar with emoji shortcuts, ShortMoji is the perfect tool for you ! 🤠

- **Support** : I'm committed to regularly update ShortMoji with new emojis and features. Contributions are welcome, submit pull requests or suggest ideas to help it grow ! 🔥

## Licence
Free project under the [GNU license](https://github.com/TooFuW/ShortMoji/blob/main/LICENSE). Do what you want with it! 🚀

## Roadmap
- Add a way for the user to know that the program is running
- Update the README with a GIF to show an example of the program being used
- Add a special characters shortcut support
